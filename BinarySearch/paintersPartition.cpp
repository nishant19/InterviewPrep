// You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

// 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
// cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
// A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
// configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
// invalid.
// Return the ans % 10000003

// Input :
// K : Number of painters
// T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
// L : A List which will represent length of each board

// Output:
//      return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
// Example

// Input : 
//   K : 2
//   T : 5
//   L : [1, 10]
// Output : 50
